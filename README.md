# BBH
This is a report that describes the steps taken to find the best bidirectional hits between the bacteria Thermophagus xiamenensis and Proteiniclasticum ruminis. This was accomplished using BLAST and python scripts to calculate conserved sequences and Shannon entropy. This report was completed for the Masters in Bioinformatics at KU Leuven. 

"BLAST, or the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (Sayers et al., 2022), finds
alignments between genes or proteins and returns e value, or a value measuring the probability of
the matches occurring by random instead of through the conservation of sequences. Homologs are
similar genes that share a common ancestor, but have been changed either by speciation to become
orthologs, or duplication to become paralogs. Thermophagus xiamenensis is an anaerobic, gram
positive bacteria that was first discovered in a hot spring in Xiamen, China. The bacteria is slightly
thermophilic and shows positive catalase activity (Gao et al., 2013). Another anaerobic but gram
positive bacteria, Proteiniclasticum ruminis, was isolated from a yak rumen. There, its main job
was to proteolytically aid in digestion and fermentation of the grasses on the Qinghaiâ€“Tibetan
Plateau, China (Zhang et al., 2010). This study explores the evolutionary relationship of these two
bacteria through the identification of best bidirectional hits (BBH), the construction of
phylogenetic and species trees, and the calculation of conserved sequences."
